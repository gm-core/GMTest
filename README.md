## Introduction

Gamatas is a collection of GML scripts to add automated testing to GameMaker.
Just import the scripts into your project, and you're ready to start writing some tests!

## Installation

Download the latest [gamatas.gml from releases](https://github.com/twisterghost/gamatas/releases) and import the scripts
into your project.

## Example

There is an example .gmx file in the top level `example` directory.

### Step 1 - Define the test suite

Create an object to house the tests for a suite. You can have as many test
suites as you want. Each suite is represented by an object.

In the `create` event of your object, use the `test_init()` function to define
your test:

```GML
test_init("Player Health and Death Tests");
```

### Step 2 - Write some tests

Gamatas will run through tests in order based on your User Defined events. On
your test object, add a `User Defined 0` event. This is the first user defined
event, and therefore will be the first test to run.

Now, define a specific test with `describe()`:

```GML
describe("Player Takes Damage", "Should cause the health variable to be lower")
```
Next, its time to write the actual test code. Write some code to ensure that
there is a player object in the game, then hurt it, then check that it has
lower health than before.

```GML
instance_create(100, 100, obj_player);
var oldHP = obj_player.hp;
var damageAmount = 10;
hurt_player(damageAmount); // A script to cause damage to the player.

assert(obj_player.hp, oldHP - damageAmount);

test_end();
```

`assert(x, y)` ensures that `x` and `y` are equal. See the [API](#api) for all
documentation on assertions.

`test_end()` finishes the test and moves on to the next `User Defined` event.

When you have written the tests, your last User Defined event should contain:

```GML
test_suite_pass();
```

This will alert Gamatas that the entire test suite for that test object has
passed, and to either continue on to the next test suite, or end the game with
a status report of all your tests.

> **Note:** All tests should have their own rooms. Make a room with nothing but the
> test running object and any objects you need to run the tests. All test rooms
> should be back-to-back, so Gamatas can run through all of them.

## API

### Test Management

#### `test_init(name)`

Initializes a test suite with the given name.

#### `describe(title, description)`

Defines an individual test named `title`, expecting the behavior defined in
`description`.

#### `test_end()`

Ends the current individual test, passing on to the next test or failing and
quitting.

#### `test_fail()`

Forces the current test to fail. Mainly used by assert functions, but can be
called directly if need be.

#### `test_suite_pass()`

Passes the current test suite, to be called on the final user defined event on 
the test object. If there is a room after the current one, it will move on to
that room, otherwise, quits the game with an information dump in the console.

### Assert Types

All assertions can optionally take a custom error message as a third argument.

#### `assert(value, expectedValue [, customMessage])`

Ensures that the given `value` is equal to `expectedValue`.

#### `assert_not(value, unexpectedValue [, customMessage])`

Ensures that the given `value` is NOT equal to `unexpectedValue`.

#### `assert_exists(object [, customMessage])`

Ensures that an instance of `object` exists in the room.

#### `assert_does_not_exist(object [, customMessage])`

Ensures that an instance of `object` does not exist in the room.

### Utility

#### `info(string1[, string2, string3, ... string16])`

Combines all of the given strings and prints them all to the console. Only the
first string is mandatory. If you are using a version of GameMaker that does not
support the console output, you may want to change this function to output to a
medium of your liking. Alternates of this file are on the way.
